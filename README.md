# Follow-Back
This program can be used to find who doesn't follow you back on Instagram and potentially other social media 

Login to Insta and download your data by following the instructions in the link below. Select JSON as the format, it will be sent to your email by Instagram. https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920

Download the folder emailed by Instagram

Open the folder and click on the folder titled "followers_and_following". Find the files "followers.json" and "following.json" in this folder.

Copy the "followers.json" and "following.json" into a new folder that you create

Open this new folder in VSCode and create a new file inside called "followback.py", and copy into it the code of this repository's followback.py

Run followback.py and find out who isn't following you back!

**Note**
This is a relatively simple program, but I wanted to show that even a simple program can have a practical use. Code doesn't need to be super complex to be great!
